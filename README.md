I've been researching on a method for predicting cryptocurrency prices using deep learning. The bottom line is that it
doesn't work. I've released this code for share my work. This commit is only the last version and I've already
tested hundreds of models and approches. If you came here via search, don't waste your time like I did.

Instead, try price prediction through neural language model of news, or using Kenneth R. French's work, or search keywords like quant portfolio optimisation and using reinforcement learning. Good luck.
